Hello, I'm Jay ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŒŠ

- I completed a role at ServiceNow as a Technical Support Engineer in CS-Integrations, and built Spring Boot REST APIs and test automation in previous roles.
- My goal is to dive into tech at the macro and micro level, currently the front end:
  - React rea
  - Next.js
  - React Native
  - Tailwind CSS
  - TypeScript
- I love music, good stories, and poems.
- To me, it is easier to have a healthy mind when you are physically healthy. I exercise, eat nutritious foods, and drink plenty of water.
