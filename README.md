Hello, I'm Jay 👋

- I completed a role at ServiceNow as a Technical Support Engineer in CS-Integrations, and built REST APIs for Spring Boot microservices, and written tests at all levels of the test automation pyramid, in previous roles.
- My goal is to dive further into tech at the macro and micro level, starting with the front end:
  - TypeScript
  - Bun
  - Drizzle
  - ElysiaJS
- I 💗 music 🎶, good stories 📖, exercise 🏋️, and poems.
