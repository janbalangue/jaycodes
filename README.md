Hello, I'm Jay 👋 🌊

- I completed a role at ServiceNow as a Technical Support Engineer in CS-Integrations, and built Spring Boot REST APIs and test automation in previous roles.
- My goal is to dive into tech at the macro and micro level, currently the front end:
  - React
  - Next.js
  - React Native
  - Tailwind CSS
  - TypeScript
- I 💗 music 🎶, good stories 📖, and poems.
- To me, it is easier to have a healthy mind 🧐 when you are physically healthy 🏃. I exercise 😴, eat nutritious foods 🍟, and drink plenty of water 🥤.
